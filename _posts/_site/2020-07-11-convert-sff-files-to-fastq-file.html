Biopython can parse several formats and can write to several formats. Biopython team posted a nice tutorial for reading and writing multiple sequence formats <a href="https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO" zoompage-fontsize="16">here</a>. Using biopython and python 3.8, I wrote a script for converting sff files to fastq files. One script for converting user supplied sff file and another one, for converting sff files in batch. Python scripts are located in github repo. Please download the scripts from <a href="https://github.com/svsuresh/python_scripts/tree/master/sff2fastq" zoompage-fontsize="16">there</a>.<br />
