well, some times we have earlier versions of ubuntu installed and want to upgrade.&nbsp; After downloading iso, many a times we don't want to burn it to CD-ROM or to USB for various reasons. Here is a tip to upgrade directly from iso.<br />
<br />
Copy iso to local folder. Mount the iso with following command:<br />
<br />
sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /path//ubuntu-xxx.iso &nbsp;/mount_point (for eg., /media/ubuntu)<br />
<br />
This should mount iso in /media/ubuntu as in the above example. Once mounted, add following line to /etc/apt/sources.list (comment out other repositories if you want to upgrade only from iso)<br />
<br />
deb file:/media/ubuntu/ubuntu <b>distroname</b> main restricted (distroname = feistry,. gutsy, maverick etc)<br />
<br />
Now update the packages with sudo apt-get update command. Run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. That is it.<br />
