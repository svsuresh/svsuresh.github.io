Well, I did install drupal on my machine and every thing is fine except that there is a learning curve (for a biologist, like my self). The other day, I flashed my buffalo router (WHR-HP-G54) with dd-wrt open source firmware (<span class="release">v24 preSP2 -b<span class="build">uild13064</span></span>). Buffalo stopped supporting this router 2 years back, i mean updating firmware. So i turned to open source firmware to flash my wireless router. Believe me you would be surprised at the available tweaking options&nbsp; in OSS. I have/had a minor problem in one or two places. But nevertheless it is worth flashing your older routers for which firmware is not updated/upgraded the manufacturers.<br />
